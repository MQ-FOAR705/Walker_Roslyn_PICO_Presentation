Collins Dictionary named Climate Strike the word of 2019:


\vspace{12pt}

"a form of protest in which people absent themselves from education or work in order to join demonstrations demanding action to counter climate change"

 \vspace{12pt}
 
"Climate Strike and public discourse" is the topic of my thesis.

 \vspace{12pt}
 
 In my research I've encountered two issues with gathering empirical data from public discourses around Climate Strike.

\vspace{12pt}
(1) Ethical considerations for collecting data from social media.

\vspace{12pt}
(2) How do I validate the hashtag public "ClimateStrike" on Twitter as a global conversation?

\vspace{12pt}
As a solution I've written an R script to scrape Twitter.





 \vspace{12pt}
 
%Praesent dolor nibh, malesuada quis convallis sit amet, volutpat at purus. Suspendisse sed velit quis turpis venenatis fermentum ut sed tellus. Ut eu lacus ultricies, elementum ex gravida, gravida elit. Donec gravida nisl sit amet nulla vestibulum, in malesuada diam varius. Donec sodales efficitur nulla, non tincidunt nibh commodo nec.

This proof of concept has three main goals:
\usebeamerfont{bodytext} 
\item 
(1) send request to Twitter's stream APIs
\item 
(2) retrieve data
\item 
(1) format data into a structure 
\item 
As a social media researcher, I wanted to access public social media postings as data, so that I could analyse the data collected under a hashtag public and identify discourse circulation patterns. As a social media researcher, I wanted to extract tweets based on a hashtag through metadata (place).

Quality assurance
\usebeamerfont{bodytext} 
\item The acceptance tests for this proof of concept includes whether the data retrieved is in an accessible format that enables the exporting, sorting, collecting, analysis, and archiving of the data output. 
\item 
The acceptance criteria includes the use of automated tools to access and manipulate the data output.
\item 
These acceptances have been met by this proof of concept.

Limitations of the proof of concept
\usebeamerfont{bodytext} 
\item 
(1) Access to data on Twitter requires a personal application programming interface (API) key. Source: https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps
\item 
(2) Before using this software a user requires a secret pair for the OAuth flow.
\item 
(3) The process of accessing Twitter changes frequently, so that software written to interact with the Twitter client requires frequent testing and revision.
\item 
(4) None of the four private pieces of identity and authentication information should ever be committed to public source control, in order to protect your application and/or user account from compromise or misuse.
